# Nuclear Roguelike
Nuclear Inc. is a multi-trillion dollar "clean" nuclear energy company spanning across all of North America.

In a failed case of corporate espionage between rival companies, all that was uncovered were implications of tax fraud, and mass dumping of waste wherever they pleased.

Of course, a police investigation soon followed, revealing much more terrifying experiments being conducted... that is, until somebody somewhere was paid off.

The lead detective was silenced, the outsourced freelancer framed for murder, and the investigation shut down.


Nobody can save the continent from near certain destruction.

Nuclear RL is a retro themed modern setting traditional roguelike, with guns and stuff.

Eh, let's try that again.

Nuclear RL is a retro themed modern setting traditional roguelike, with various types of guns, playstyles, annoying as shit enemies, and unique combat mechanics.

You play as either a cop let go after the shutdown of the investigation, the former detective who's slipped out of their ankle monitor, or the contractor hired by the desperate detective (then subsequently made into the target of a manhunt) who knows too much.
