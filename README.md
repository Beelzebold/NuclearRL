# Nuclear Roguelike
Nuclear Inc. is a multi-trillion dollar "clean" nuclear energy company spanning across all of North America.

In a failed case of corporate espionage between rival companies, all that was uncovered were implications of tax fraud, and mass dumping of waste wherever they pleased.

Of course, a police investigation soon followed, revealing much more terrifying experiments being conducted... that is, until somebody somewhere was paid off.

The lead detective was silenced, the outsourced freelancer framed for murder, and the investigation shut down.


Nobody can save the continent from near certain destruction.
